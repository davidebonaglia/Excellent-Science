## Project Description
Starting in 2014 and concluding in 2020, the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme, with a budget of EUR 80 billion, set the foundation for research and innovation funding. As its successor, Horizon Europe, takes off with a EUR 95.5 billion allocation, insights from Horizon 2020 are critical to optimize its deployment and shape the strategies for the upcoming FP10.

The Phase 1 Final Study Report evaluates the accomplishments of Horizon 2020, particularly its commitment to "Excellent Science" - one of its three foundational pillars alongside Industrial Leadership and Societal Challenges. This concept of Excellent Science is characterized by pioneering science that positions the EU at the global forefront, fostering groundbreaking ideas and attracting elite researchers globally.

A collaborative effort led by experts from UNU-MERIT, in association with Idea Consult and PPMI, scrutinized various facets of the study. The focus was to discern the contributions of different flagship projects, programme parts, and funding agencies to the paradigm of "Excellent Science."

## Key Takeaways
Among the findings and recommendations that the study puts forth for future work programmes are the following:
* Excellent science should continue to be a core part of future programmes in order to keep driving Europe forward as a global center of research and innovation. Participation remains low, however, in widening countries.
* Horizon 2020’s biggest challenge was oversubscription, with proposals far exceeding available grants. Strengthening the Seal of Excellence – a quality label given to high-ranking projects Horizon 2020 could not fund due to budgetary constraints – as well as widening funding sources from national funding bodies could help tackle this bottleneck.
Projects that aimed to help develop the skills of researchers could benefit from clearer strategies, objectives, operalisation and targets.
* Open science – which currently focuses on using digital and collaborative technologies to spread knowledge as soon as it is available – should continue to be promoted and explained.
* There stands room for improving the monitoring of the programme’s impact in terms of inducing change at various institutional, organizational and governance levels, as well as in terms of data collection on how Horizon 2020’s actions were communicated.
Implementing Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) could benefit from increased focus on its different components, including knowledge hubs for each, as well as clearer targets.
* The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA), a funding mechanism that helps boost the career of early career researchers, should be further developed in order to enhance its capacity building and academic enhancement objectives.
* Funders may need to reflect on how to increase the additionality of European Research Council grants, aimed at funding excellence science.

## Contributors
The UNU-MERIT team that contributed to this report consists of the following researchers, PhD fellows, and affiliated staff: Davide Bonaglia, Diego Chavarro, Tommaso Ciarli, Nordine Es-Sadki, Kirsten Haaland, Ad Notten, Bulat Sanditov, Fabiana Visentin, Lili Wang, René Wintjes and Yagmur Yildiz.

Under the overall project leadership of PPMI and partnering with Idea Consult, the team worked on several aspects of the study, among which are two case studies on the H2020 Flagship projects “Graphene” and “Human Brain Project”, a bibliometric analysis assessing the efficiency of the H2020 programme parts and funding bodies, and two separate counterfactual analyses, consisting of multiple econometric models each with a different focus and different level of sophistication. The first analysis consists of a productivity model that looks at Horizon 2020 as a whole and its programmes in particular, while the second analysis is focused on the ERC and MSCA-IF (sub-)programmes, and uses several estimation strategies to assess their impact on funded researchers. This analysis looks at the impact of Horizon 2020 funding using pre- and post-grant data.
